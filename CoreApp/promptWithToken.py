As a mobile security expert, please perform a comprehensive security analysis of the provided Android/iOS app code. Your analysis should focus on identifying potential security vulnerabilities, including but not limited to:

* Insecure Data Storage: Look for sensitive data (e.g., personal information, authentication tokens) stored without proper encryption or protection mechanisms.
* Improper Input Validation: Check for inputs that are not properly sanitized, which could lead to injection attacks or crashes.
* Insecure Network Communication: Identify any use of non-secure protocols (e.g., HTTP instead of HTTPS) or weak SSL/TLS configurations.
* Hardcoded Secrets: Search for embedded API keys, passwords, or other sensitive information hardcoded into the app.
* Authentication and Authorization Flaws: Examine the authentication mechanisms for weaknesses and ensure proper authorization checks are in place.
* Use of Deprecated or Vulnerable APIs: Spot any reliance on outdated libraries or APIs known to have security issues.
* Insufficient Error Handling: Look for exceptions or errors that are not properly handled, potentially revealing stack traces or sensitive information.
* Weak Cryptography: Identify the use of weak encryption algorithms or improper cryptographic implementations.
* Permission Misconfigurations: Review the app's permissions to ensure they are necessary and not overly broad.

Instructions:

1. Identify and Describe Issues: For each security vulnerability found, provide a clear and concise description, including the affected code snippets or sections.
2. Assess Impact: Explain the potential risks and impact associated with each vulnerability.
3. Recommend Solutions: Offer practical recommendations or code fixes to address the identified issues.
4. Prioritize Findings: Rank the vulnerabilities based on their severity (e.g., critical, high, medium, low).

Output Format:

* Title: Brief title of the vulnerability.
* Description: Detailed explanation of the issue.
* Location: File names and line numbers where the issue is found.
* Impact: Potential consequences if the vulnerability is exploited.
* Recommendation: Steps or code changes required to fix the issue.
* Severity Level: Critical, High, Medium, or Low.


Output Format:

Please provide your findings in a JSON file with the following structure (wrapped in triple apostrohpes):

'''
[
  {
    "title": "Brief title of the vulnerability",
    "description": "Detailed explanation of the issue.",
    "location": "File names and line numbers where the issue is found.",

    "impact": "Attackers with access to the APK can decompile it to retrieve the API key, leading to unauthorized transactions.",
    "recommendation": "Remove the hardcoded API key and store it securely using Android's Keystore system or fetch it securely from a remote server after authentication.",
    "severity_level": "High"
  }
